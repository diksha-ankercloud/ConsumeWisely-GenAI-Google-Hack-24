      "* **Vegetable Oil:** Used for frying the puffs, giving them their crispy texture. The specific oil used can vary (corn, canola, sunflower) depending on the manufacturer. \n",
      "* **Cheese Seasoning:** This is the key to the cheesy flavor. It typically includes:\n",
      "    * **Whey:** A milk protein that contributes to the cheesy flavor and texture.\n",
      "    * **Cheddar Cheese:** Provides the characteristic cheddar flavor.\n",
      "    * **Canola Oil:** Adds to the seasoning's texture and helps it adhere to the puffs.\n",
      "    * **Maltodextrin:** A type of sugar derived from cornstarch, used as a thickener and to help the seasoning stick. \n",
      "    * **Salt:**  Used to enhance flavor.\n",
      "    * **Whey Protein Concentrate:**  Further contributes to the cheesy flavor and texture.\n",
      "    * **Monosodium Glutamate (MSG):** A flavor enhancer.\n",
      "    * **Natural and Artificial Flavors:** Added to enhance the cheese flavor.\n",
      "    * **Lactic Acid & Citric Acid:**  These acids help to adjust the pH and enhance the cheesy flavor.\n",
      "    * **Artificial Color (Yellow 6):**  Gives the puffs their characteristic orange color. \n",
